# [didtheyghost.me](https://didtheyghost.me/?utm_source=githubrepoheader) - Job Tracking Platform

A community-driven platform that helps students and job seekers track their internship applications, share interview experiences, and discover tech opportunities.

> **This isn’t a job scraper, or yet another job board.**  
> _Think of it like the Internet Archive — but for job applications._ <br>
> _Built by job applicants, for job applicants._


> [!NOTE]
> We're currently starting with a focus on **tech internship roles in Singapore**, as most of our early users are based there.  
> That said, you're welcome to contribute even if you're applying to roles in other countries or outside of tech.


## Why use didtheyghost.me?

See a job listing (e.g., on LinkedIn), apply for it, and haven’t heard back? Use **[didtheyghost.me](https://didtheyghost.me/?utm_source=githubrepob)** to check if others have received replies, interviews, or offers. It helps answer burning questions like:

- **How long does it usually take to hear back from company X?**  
- **Has anyone heard back from this role?**  
- **What are the online assessments/interview rounds like?**  
- **When do company X usually hire?**  
- **And lastly, did they ghost me?**

### Install dependencies

Ensure you're using the correct Node.js version, using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```bash
nvm use # Uses the version specified in .nvmrc
```

Install dependencies using your preferred package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`):

```bash
npm ci # For npm - installs exact versions from package-lock.json
```


### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Setup pnpm (optional)

If you are using `pnpm`, you need to add the following code to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@heroui-org/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.
